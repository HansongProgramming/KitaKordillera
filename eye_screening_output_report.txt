Notes: Prototype eye-screening from single image. NOT a diagnosis. Ensure frontal pose, no glasses (if possible), good light.

- Scleral redness (conjunctivitis/irritation proxy)
  Present: False
  Confidence: 0.00
  Reasoning: Redness index L=0.44, R=0.45. Threshold ~0.63.

- Ptosis (eyelid droop proxy via aperture)
  Present: False
  Confidence: 0.00
  Reasoning: Aperture L=0.49, R=0.48, asymmetry=0.01. Angle/pose can confound.

- Strabismus screening (gaze asymmetry)
  Present: True
  Confidence: 1.00
  Reasoning: Gaze angle diff ≈ 31.1°. Requires frontal, well-lit image.

- Anisocoria (pupil size difference)
  Present: False
  Confidence: 0.00
  Reasoning: Relative radius difference ≈ 1.9%.

- Leukocoria (white pupillary reflex) – cancer risk flag
  Present: False
  Confidence: 0.00
  Reasoning: Bright pupil intensity ≈ 89.4/255; ONLY a rough flag—seek urgent clinical exam if seen repeatedly.
